<b>Security Settings</b><br>
<br>
The Security tab allows you to setup automatic entry of Pin Code for the SIM card you are currently using. Two levels of Pin Code entry are available:

<ul>
<li>After Soft Reset or Plugin Enable
<li>When Radio Turned On
</ul>

You can select one or both checkboxes. After selection, tap the Create PIN button, enter your Pin Code and tap OK.
You now need to enter it again to confirm you have entered it correctly. Tap OK to finish. Tapping Cancel at any
time cancels the current operation.<br>
<br>
If you wish to change your PIN, you can do so by tapping the Change PIN button. When doing so you will be asked
to enter your current PIN, after which you will be asked for your new PIN. Tap OK to accept, and then enter your PIN again
to confirm. Tap OK to finish. Tapping Cancel at any time cancels the current operation.<br>
<br>
To set automatic Pin entry for your second SIM card, switch to your second SIM and repeat the process above.<br>
<br>
The PIN numbers can be different for each SIM.
<br>
The PIN entry is only required for a SIM if it is configured in the phone settings to need a PIN and the SIM 
requests it - that is, when radio is turned on. These settings in SIM Status Switcher are meant to supply the 
PIN on request when the radio starts, either because of a soft-reset or because the radio has been turned off 
then on - for example, when the Switch SIMs option is used. 'After plugin enable' means that if your phone is 
waiting for the PIN and you then enable the SIM Status Switcher plugin, it will enter the PIN 
if you have specified it to do so.

The Language tab allows you to change your current and/or default language which is used throughout the product.<br>

The default language can be changed by selecting the appropriate language from the list box and tapping on the Make Default button.<br>
<br>
The current language is shown at the bottom of the screen, when the current language is changed this takes effect immediately.
