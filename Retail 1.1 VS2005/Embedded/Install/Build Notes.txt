WiViT SIM Status Switcher Version 1.0, Build 0705 - 16th July, 2005
===================================================================

Issues we are aware of and are investigating:
---------------------------------------------

Bluetooth icon sometimes disappears after a soft reset. If this happens,
removing SIM Status Switcher from the Today screen, resetting the device,
then re-adding SIM Status Switcher will restore the icon.

If Radio off for a long time, sometimes it is not possible to turn it
back on without a soft-reset.

Sometimes the phone dialer window appears with 'SIM status unknown' after
switching SIMs. This might happen when you have configured SIM Status Switcher
to automatically provide a PIN number. The PIN number has been entered
successfully and tapping Cancel from the phone dialer will return you the
the Today screen where SSS will function normally.

Sometimes after a soft-reset, the phone dialer will prompt for you to enter
a PIN even when you have configured SIM Status Switcher to automatically
provide it. However, the PIN number has been entered successfully and tapping
Cancel from the phone PIN prompt will return you the the Today screen where
SSS will function normally.

On Windows Mobile 2003 Second edition devices, corruption of the 'Owner' Today
item can occur. This only happens if you return from Today->Items to Settings
and then immediately back to the Today Screen. If you wait a few seconds after
tapping OK on the Today->Items before tapping the X on the Settings dialog, then
this can be avoided. If corruption does occur, it usually clears within a second
or two. It will only present a problem to users who do a lot of Today Screen
configuration changes within a relatively short time. We have tested out this
problem with other non-Microsoft add-ins and to some degree or other the same
thing occurs. We therefore suspect it is more to do with the 'Owner' plug-in
than it is with us.
