# SIM Status Switcher
Co-Creator of one of the first Mobile Apps to allow **SIM Switching** built for mobile devices such as the O2 XDA.

## What is SIM Status Switcher
This was one of the very first mobile apps which allows you to switch SIMs easily and with minimal user interaction. The mobile app was named SIM Status Switcher and was available for a whole range of mobile devices such as the O2 XDA and a whole load of other mobiles at that time as long as they were running Windows Mobile 2003 and they had a dual sim adaptor fitted.

The main purpose of this app was to combine your home and business SIMs into a single mobile device, with automatic PIN entry and configurable tap actions controlling your SIMs couldn’t be easier and supported English, French and German languages.

The switching of the SIMs was all done without you having to turn off your phone or enter your PIN code and with the ability to turn off just your GSM Radio without having to turn off your Bluetooth or Wireless connectivity was back then unheard off.
